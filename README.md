- 👋 Hi, I’m @MinimumXMaximum
- 👀 I’m currently interested in Python and Ethical Hacking (my favorite topics are Hardware Hacking and Forensics)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: everything, I don't have a super specific focus yet
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that sounds interesting and where a beginner can contribute
- 📫 How to reach me would be this github profile
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her :3 
- ⚡ Boring fact: I am trying to use my non-dominant hand more often for an extra challenge
